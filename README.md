# dropdown-menu

This project shows three different ways to create a dropdown menu system.

css-dropdown-menu.html - This file accomplishes the task using only CSS. No scripting is used to operate the menu

js-dropdown-menu.html - This file shows how to use straight JavaScript to make the menu operate and adds a slight delay before closing each menu.

jquery-dropdown-menu.html - This file shows the same menu system but using jQuery to operate the menus.
